# Agile Fast Movers - Quality Stocks with 50%+ Movement Potential

## Overview

This document explains how to identify "agile fast movers" - stocks that can rapidly move 50%+ but have solid fundamentals and real businesses.

## User Requirement

> "Prefer to find agile fast movers like OPEN, RZLV, RXRX, RGTI, SRFM, JMIA, that can rapidly go 50%+ but also have good foundational products or financials"

**Key Examples:**
- **OPEN** (Opendoor) - Proptech, real estate platform
- **RZLV** (Rezolve AI) - AI-powered retail solutions
- **RXRX** (Recursion Pharmaceuticals) - AI drug discovery
- **RGTI** (Rigetti Computing) - Quantum computing
- **SRFM** (Surf Air Mobility) - Electric aviation
- **JMIA** (Jumia) - African e-commerce

## What Makes a Good Agile Mover?

### The Sweet Spot

Unlike penny stocks (pure speculation) or mega-caps (too slow to move), agile movers have:

✅ **Real Business**
- Revenue > $10M (established operations)
- Actual products/services (not vaporware)
- Growth trajectory (can justify higher valuations)

✅ **Market Cap Sweet Spot: $300M - $20B**
- Big enough: Real business with revenue
- Small enough: Can move 50-200% on catalysts
- Optimal range: $500M - $5B

✅ **High Volatility**
- ATR > 5% (daily movement range)
- Beta > 1.5 (more volatile than market)
- Can swing 20-50%+ in days/weeks

✅ **Good Liquidity**
- Volume > 500K (preferably > 1M)
- Tight bid-ask spreads
- Easy entry/exit

✅ **Growth Sectors**
- AI/ML, quantum computing, fintech
- Proptech, mobility, emerging markets
- Clean energy, biotech innovation, space
- Sectors with catalysts and market attention

### What to AVOID

❌ **Penny Stocks** (< $5, < $300M market cap)
- Examples: SOUN, BTBT, WKEY
- Problem: No fundamentals, pure speculation
- Risk: Dilution, reverse splits, scams

❌ **Mega-Caps** (> $1T market cap)
- Examples: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL
- Problem: Too big to move 50%+ quickly
- Reality: Need $500B+ catalyst to move 50%

❌ **Meme Stocks** (hype-driven, no business logic)
- Examples: GME, AMC (during 2021 mania)
- Problem: Fundamentals don't support valuations
- Risk: When hype fades, crash hard

## Filter Criteria

### 1. Market Cap Filter

```
Minimum: $300M (small-cap floor)
Maximum: $20B (mid-cap ceiling)
Optimal: $500M - $5B (sweet spot)
```

**Why this works:**
- < $300M: Too risky, often penny stocks
- $300M - $500M: Small-cap, higher risk/reward
- **$500M - $5B: OPTIMAL - Big moves possible**
- $5B - $20B: Mid-cap, still good movement
- > $20B: Too big, slower to move

**Math:**
- $1B stock needs $500M catalyst to move 50%
- $100B stock needs $50B catalyst to move 50%
- Sweet spot: Meaningful catalysts can cause big moves

### 2. Volatility Filter

```
Minimum ATR: 5% (daily movement range)
Preferred ATR: 8%+ (high volatility)
Minimum Beta: 1.5 (vs market)
```

**Why this works:**
- High ATR = Can move 50%+ in days
- High beta = Moves amplified vs market
- Compression → explosion works best on volatile stocks

### 3. Liquidity Filter

```
Minimum Volume: 500K shares/day
Preferred Volume: 1M+ shares/day
```

**Why this works:**
- Can enter/exit positions without slippage
- Tight bid-ask spreads (lower trading costs)
- Options have volume (if using options strategies)

### 4. Price Filter

```
Minimum: $5 (avoid penny stocks)
Maximum: $500 (easier % moves)
Optimal: $10 - $100
```

**Why this works:**
- < $5: Penny stock stigma, delisting risk
- $5 - $10: Acceptable, watch for dilution
- **$10 - $100: OPTIMAL price range**
- > $500: Harder to move % (psychology)

### 5. Fundamental Filter

```
Minimum Revenue: $10M (real business)
Preferred Revenue: $100M+ (established)
Has Products: Required (not pre-revenue)
```

**Why this works:**
- Revenue = Real business (not speculation)
- Products = Can execute (not just ideas)
- Financials justify growth potential

### Rating Scale

- **90-100: EXCELLENT** - Prime agile mover

- **70-79: GOOD** - Solid candidate
- **60-69: MODERATE** - Acceptable
- **< 60: POOR** - Not recommended

## How to Use

### 1. Market-Wide Scan

Scan ALL US stocks (~8,000) and apply filters:

```python
from qaht.equities_options.market_scanner import scan_market

# Get all stocks meeting basic criteria
universe = scan_market(
    min_price=5.0,              # Avoid penny stocks
    min_avg_volume=500_000,     # Good liquidity
    max_market_cap=20_000_000_000  # Agile mover ceiling
)

# Result: ~1,000-2,000 stocks
```

### 2. Apply Agile Mover Filters

Filter for volatility and fundamentals:

```python
from qaht.equities_options.agile_movers_filter import AgileMoverFilter

# Get curated agile mover universe
agile_universe = AgileMoverFilter.get_agile_mover_universe()

# Score individual stocks
for symbol in universe:
    stock_data = fetch_stock_data(symbol)  # price, mcap, volume, beta, atr, revenue
    result = AgileMoverFilter.score_agile_mover_potential(stock_data)

    if result['score'] >= 70:
        print(f"{symbol}: {result['score']} - {result['rating']}")
```

### 3. Run Compression → Explosion Detection

Focus on agile movers for best results:

```python
from qaht.equities_options.features.tech import compute_all_technical_features

# Compute features only for agile movers (not all 8,000 stocks)
for symbol in agile_universe:
    features = compute_all_technical_features(symbol)

    # Check for compression
    if features['bb_width_pct'] < 0.10:  # Compressed
        if features['ma_alignment_score'] > 0.7:  # Aligned
            print(f"{symbol}: COMPRESSION DETECTED - High explosion potential")
```

## Example: Scoring OPEN (Opendoor)

**Stock Data:**
- Price: $2.50
- Market Cap: $1.6B
- Volume: 8M shares/day
- Beta: 2.3
- ATR: 9.2%
- Revenue: $8.1B annually

**Scoring:**
- Market Cap ($1.6B): 30 points (optimal range)
- ATR (9.2%): 25 points (high)
- Beta (2.3): 10 points (very high)
- Volume (8M): 15 points (excellent)
- Price ($2.50): 2 points (penny stock risk)
- Revenue ($8.1B): 20 points (strong)
- Sector (proptech): 5 points

**Total: 107 → 100 (capped)**

**Rating: EXCELLENT**

**Reasons:**
- Optimal market cap for big moves
- Extremely high volatility (ATR 9%, beta 2.3)
- Excellent liquidity (8M volume)
- Strong revenue ($8B) - real business

**Flags:**
- Price < $5 (penny stock stigma)
- Watch for dilution risk

## Strategy Recommendations

### Position Sizing for Agile Movers

**Higher Risk = Smaller Positions**

```
Score 90-100 (EXCELLENT): 3-5% of capital
Score 80-89  (VERY GOOD): 2-3% of capital
Score 70-79  (GOOD):      1-2% of capital
Score < 70   (MODERATE):  0.5-1% of capital
```

### Entry Timing

**Best Entry: Compression Phase**
- BB width < 20th percentile (tight bands)
- MA convergence (spreads compressed)
- Social delta increasing (building attention)
- Volume declining (coiling for move)

**Avoid Buying:**
- After 20%+ move (likely too late)
- During peak social attention (top signal)
- When BB extremely wide (overextended)

### Exit Strategy

**Take Profits:**
- First 50%: Take 50% position off at +50% gain
- Let rest run: Trail stop at 20%
- Full exit: If compression thesis breaks

**Stop Loss:**
- Mental stop: -15% from entry
- Hard stop: -20% maximum loss

### Options Strategy

**Best for Agile Movers:**
- Calls during compression (cheap premiums)
- Longer dated (30-60 DTE) to catch explosion
- Strike: ATM or slightly OTM
- Sell half at 100% gain, let rest run
